# 🧠 Themed Hangman Game (Python + Tkinter)

This is a **GUI-based Hangman game** built with Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to select a **theme** before the game begins, such as:
- ⚙️ General
- 🤖 AI / Machine Learning
- 🏥 Medical
- 🐾 Animals
- 🎬 Movies
- 🌍 Geography

The game **loads words dynamically from text files**, making it easy to add new themes without changing the code.
